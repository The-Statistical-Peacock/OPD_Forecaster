## About This Application

This RShiny web application is designed to predict future OPD (Outpatient Department) waiting list numbers. The application leverages a **DuckDB** database to store and manage the underlying data. For forecasting, the app uses the **AutoArima** model, an automated time series analysis method, to make predictions based on historical data. The user-friendly interface allows for real-time insights and provides a robust tool for monitoring and managing OPD waiting lists efficiently.
